## Note
Currently (as of March 2020), the project runs successfully without any error. However, this is a work in progress and not all key signatures/chords are yet added to the project. Most chords don't yet have sounds because they haven't been added. Only keys C major and C minor have chord sounds.

Will try to add more key signatures and chord sounds  when time permits.
